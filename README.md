```
This practical demonstrates the use of the fork() system call in C to create multiple processes and distinguish between parent, child, and sibling processes. 
By working with fork(), getpid(), and getppid(), the program explores fundamental concepts of process creation and hierarchy in Linux-based operating systems.

Through this exercise, we learn:

How processes are created and managed using fork()

How to identify process relationships using process IDs

How the execution order may vary due to CPU scheduling

This practical provides a foundational understanding of process control, which is essential for systems programming and understanding how operating systems handle multitasking.
