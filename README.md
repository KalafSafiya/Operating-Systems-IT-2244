### Day 13 - 19th of May 2025

This collection of programs demonstrates basic decision-making and looping concepts in C:

- **If-Else**: Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on age.
- **Ternary Operator**: Short-hand version of if-else for eligibility check.
- **Switch Statement**: 
  - Maps numbers (1-7) to weekdays.
  - Provides a mini astrology program based on a "life path number".
- **Loops**:
  - **While Loop**: Prints numbers 1 to 10.
  - **For Loop**: 
    - Generates Fibonacci sequence up to a given term.
    - Calculates factorial of a number.
- **String Handling**: Accepts two strings and concatenates them using `strcat()`.
- **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: Converts a binary input into its decimal form.
- **Array Operations**: Accepts an array and finds its maximum and minimum values.
- **Pascalâ€™s Triangle**: Prints Pascal's Triangle using nested loops and combinatorics.

These examples help reinforce conditional logic, iterations, array operations, basic string manipulation, and arithmetic logic in C programming.
